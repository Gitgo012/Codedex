# Suppose we want to build a database of students in a school, where each student has different attributes, like name, year, GPA, and enrollment status.

# Using our previous knowledge, we could represent each student as a list:
# Lists with student id, name, year, gpa, and enrolled status

student_1 = [1001, 'Asiqur', 10, 3.7, True]
student_2 = [1002, 'Jerry', 9, 3.8, True]
student_3 = [1003, 'Rose', 12, 3.6, False]

# However, we have no way of knowing which item corresponds to which attribute â€“ it will get messy fast. For example, does student_2[1] refer to the name, year, or GPA?

# This is where classes come in!

# With classes, we can create our own data types and use them to model everyday objects with unique characteristics and behaviors.

# Classes serve as a template for the objects created using that class. Simply put, a class is like a blueprint. It can make a bunch of objects with identical sets of attributes, similar to how a car manufacturer can use a model blueprint to build hundreds of cars with different colors, interiors, wheels, etc.
#basic syntax
# class Name:
  # Attributes inside
  
  
# The class keyword followed by class name creates the class. By convention, the class name is capitalized.
